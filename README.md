# RefViz - Reference vizualizer

Uses references to map out a graph of the code base, maps are flexible and can be for a single file or folder.

Began development of RefViz in relation to writing a thesis about maintenance for [QuickFeed](https://github.com/quickfeed/quickfeed/), to better understand its codebase.
